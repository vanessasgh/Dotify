# Your App by Vanessa Sugiharto

This is an app for homework 2 that is a music player list where you can scroll through the song list. Clicking on one of the song will display a mini player with the chosen song description and a shuffle button. You can shuffle the song list by clicking that button. Clicking on the mini player will pull up the homework 1 page, which is the focused and descriptive version of that one song.
