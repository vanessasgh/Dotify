# Your App by Vanessa Sugiharto

This is an app for homework 4 that is a music player list where you can scroll through the song list. The functionality that was added onto it is in the settings when an individual song is clicked on. When the setting button is clicked and the profile button is clicked afterwards, it will display the user info that is grabbed from an online source.
