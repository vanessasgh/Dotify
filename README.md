# Your App by Vanessa Sugiharto

This is an app for homework 1 that is a music player where you can click previous and next songs, click the play button and records how many times it has been clicked, and change/edit your username.

## Extra credit
I have completed extra credit #1 which is that the user cannot apply a new username if edit text field is empty.
