# Your App by Vanessa Sugiharto

This is an app for homework 5 that is a music player where you can turn on and off your notifications in the application itself. It will be when a song is chosen and is opened to the song detail, then the settings button is clicked, and then notification. Turning on the notification switch will give you notification about a new song released every 20 minutes, and clicking on that notification will direct you to a page of that song. Turning off the notification will stop doing this.

## Extra credit
1. Clicking the notification will launch PlayerActivity that passes in the data to the activity and show the song in the player.
